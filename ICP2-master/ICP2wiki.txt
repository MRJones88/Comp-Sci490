## RWD Task

This task was to take some given source code and modify it to look alike the given pdf file and behave in a responsive way.

1. To do this first, the header was made into two columns; one column at 20% for the picture and the other column at 80% for the text. 

2. The Image in the middle needed to span the entire page so we used the style feature width: 100% to scale the image every time the window was resized 

3. For the featured work section, we used three columns set at 33.33% of the screen. this gave us an even three column workspace. 

4. the pictures in each column were separated from the text via a divide tag <"div"> 

5. Lastly, the headings have an uppercase text-transform added to them.
