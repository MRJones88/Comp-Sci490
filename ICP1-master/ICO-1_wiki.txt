## Steps
* after cloning the repository to my pc, I added the /source and /documents folder and created the index.html file.
* next I added a title and standard style for an HTML document
* after filling in a "top bar" and "footer" I started work on the main content, all of which was nested inside the <"body"> tag.
* after finishing up all the content, I created a CSS style sheet and began to play with the look and feel of the site.
* Lastly I added the youtube video and any last touches and pushed the repository back to GitHub.
